## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
AP <- AirPassengers
str(AP)
head(AP)
# use the time series function, frequency is 12 due to 12 months
# start indicates January 1949
ts(AP, frequency = 12, start = c(1949, 1))
attributes(AP)
plot(AP)
```

```{r}
library(forecast)
model <- auto.arima(AP)
model
```
