		Temporal data visualization has been a staple visualization technique for displaying the change of a continuous variable over time. Most common examples are visualizing stock prices over time and understanding its ebbs and flows.

	\section{NY Times COVID-19}
	There are a number of data sets available to visualize the statistics regarding COVID-19 however the NY Times was one of the first few that provided these statistics early on. With that in mind, we were able to extract and parse the number of cases and deaths in the United States. More specifically, we were able to examine the trends present in different states as well as the many different counties. With this data set, it was a great opportunity to explore another avenue of temporal data visualization, that being forecasting/prediction models.
